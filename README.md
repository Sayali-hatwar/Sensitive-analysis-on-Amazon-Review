Sensitive Analysis with Vader Sentiment Scoring and Roberta Pretrained Mode

The objective is to perform sentiment analysis on Amazon reviews using the RoBERTa pretrained model and the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) tool, classifying reviews into positive, negative, and neutral categories based on attributes like rating, date, variation, verified reviews, and feedback.

The RoBERTa model, optimized for contextual understanding, is fine-tuned on the dataset, tokenizing each review to predict sentiment scores, while VADER, a rule-based model tailored for social media sentiment, processes the text to provide compound scores for sentiment classification.

The analysis involves data preprocessing steps such as cleaning, tokenization, and normalization before applying both models to evaluate and compare the sentiment of the reviews.
